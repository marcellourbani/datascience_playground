# Data science playground

This repo is a playground to test out some data science concepts from a course I'm folloiwng, [Getting Started with Data Science (Edition 2021)](https://open.sap.com/courses/ds3)

Source data is from the [our world in data covid repository](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data)

Plan to use [Orange data mining](https://orangedatamining.com/) for exploration and [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for modelling
Will need some plugin too, at the very least timeseries

I'm an absolute novice in the field

## Download data

The included getdata script will download a fresh copy of the source data:

Windows:

```shell
getdata.bat
```

Anything else:

```shell
./getdata
```
